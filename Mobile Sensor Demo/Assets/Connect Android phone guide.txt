Try these steps in-order:

1. In Unity, go to Edit -> Project Settings -> Editor, and set the "Device" to "Any Android Device"
2. Plug-in your phone.
3. Switch the connection type to USB tethering.
4. Enable developer mode (if already ON then switch it OFF before plugging in your phone)
5. Enable USB debugging (if already ON then switch it OFF before plugging in your phone)

When you will turn on USB debugging your phone will ask to allow the connected PC to access the RSA, allow it.

6. Now, switch the connection mode to "USB for Transferring files/Android Auto", the phone will again ask to allow the computer to access the RSA, allow it.
7. In Unity, go to File -> Build Settings, then select your device (which will now be visible in the "Run Device" dropdown).
8. Now, open Unity Remote 5 on your device.
9. Hit play in Unity Editor.
